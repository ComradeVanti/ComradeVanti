I mostly makes games and open-source utility libraries.

If you want to see my attempts at various programming-exercises, check out [my kata organisation](https://github.com/comradevanti-katas).

My games are also in [their own organisation](https://github.com/comradevanti-games).

Finally, if something I made was useful to you, you can give me money if you want.
